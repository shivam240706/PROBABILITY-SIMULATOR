# PROBABILITY-SIMULATOR

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Probability Simulator** is a C-based console application that allows users to explore various probability concepts interactively.  
It includes both **random probability simulations** and **deterministic probability calculations**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
### ðŸŽ² Random Probability Generators
- **Coin Toss Simulation** â€“ Simulates multiple coin tosses and counts Heads/Tails.
- **Dice Roll Simulation** â€“ Rolls a dice multiple times and records the frequency of each face.
- **Card Draw Simulation** â€“ Simulates random card suit draws from a standard deck.

### ðŸ“Š Deterministic Calculations
- **Binomial Distribution Probability**
- **Poisson Distribution Probability**
- **Basic Statistical Measures** â€“ Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation.

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works
- The program uses the C standard library functions (`rand()`, `pow()`, `exp()`) to perform simulations and probability calculations.
- A **menu-driven system** allows users to choose between simulations and deterministic calculations.
- Probability formulas implemented:
    - **Binomial Probability**:  
      \( P(X = k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \)
    - **Poisson Probability**:  
      \( P(X = k) = \frac{Î»^k e^{-Î»}}{k!} \)

## ðŸš€ Compilation & Execution
### Compile:
```bash
gcc probability_simulator.c -o probability_simulator -lm
```

### Run:
```bash
./probability_simulator
```

> **Note:** The `-lm` flag is required to link the math library.
